# Project Overview

In this project you'll take take an existing e-commerce store and refactor the application to use the `Context API`.

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React bootstrapped with Create React App

Create React App is a wonderful utility with all of the build tools preconfigured out of the box. This way, the developer can spend more time focusing on the code.

#### React Hooks

React hooks allowed for me to write relatively clean code by abstracting away a lot of state and app logic via custom hooks.

## Testing

#### Cypress

Cypress is a next generation front end testing tool built for the modern web. It enables you to write all types of tests, including nd-to-end tests, integration tests, and unit tests.

# How to Use

## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```

## Run tests

```sh
npm run cypress
```
